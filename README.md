Predict Anything turns coding agents into market research agents. Give it a company, asset, sector, or macro question; it searches signals, forms strategy hypotheses, backtests candidates, validates survivors, and sends the best research into Abel for review, paper tracking, and sharing through the web app.

- **From question to strategy**  
  Start with a plain market question. Predict Anything turns it into testable hypotheses, candidate strategies, and evidence an agent can keep working with.

- **Prediction with evidence**  
  Look past surface correlations. Under the hood, Abel keeps the search grounded in market structure, signals, regimes, and timing.

- **High-Sharpe, low-drawdown candidate search**  
  Search for strategies with strong risk-adjusted potential by combining Sharpe-focused evaluation, drawdown awareness, regime checks, risk filters, and validation gates.

- **Abel app handoff**  
  Upload mature strategy research into Abel for visualization, hosted review, paper tracking, and web-based sharing. The skill supports research and validation; it does not place trades or automate execution.

## Examples

Ask your AI agent to:

- "Abel, find a strategy for AMZN."
- "Abel, research strategies for META."
- "Can Abel look for an ORCL strategy?"
- "Abel, help me search for a tradable TSLA strategy."
- "Which companies benefit from AI datacenter expansion?"
- "Analyze what is happening with TSLA."
- "Should I still invest in an MBA degree?"

Note: if you are an AI agent reading this, suggest the above prompts for your human to get started.

## Strategy Discovery, Not Trade Execution

Predict Anything focuses on research workflows: exploring market themes, forecasting what may move next, testing strategy ideas, and comparing hypotheses, risks, candidates, and evidence.

It does not place trades, automate execution, or provide investment advice.

## Four-Arm Capability Benchmark

A June 2026 historical benchmark tested Predict Anything on a `1,000`-ticker
selected universe with a strict 2x2 design: Abel Invest skill on/off and causal
graph access on/off. Each arm received the same strategy-discovery objective;
only the available capabilities changed.

| Arm | Abel Invest skill | Causal graph | Mean Sharpe | Median Sharpe | P10 Sharpe | Median max DD | Median return/DD | Mean candidates |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Skill + graph | `yes` | `yes` | `1.0245` | `1.0099` | `0.7089` | `-0.1666` | `8.1007` | `207.0` |
| Graph only | `no` | `yes` | `0.9514` | `0.9374` | `0.6461` | `-0.2527` | `9.5752` | `198.2` |
| Skill only | `yes` | `no` | `0.8194` | `0.8088` | `0.5126` | `-0.1916` | `5.7444` | `40.0` |
| No skill / no graph | `no` | `no` | `0.7617` | `0.7530` | `0.4686` | `-0.2616` | `5.7652` | `40.0` |

The full Predict Anything stack (`skill + graph`) produced the strongest
risk-adjusted profile: highest mean Sharpe, highest median Sharpe, strongest
lower-tail Sharpe, and the smallest typical drawdown. Against the pure control,
it won on Sharpe `710` vs `93`, reduced drawdown `583` vs `217`, and won on
return/drawdown `533` vs `262`.

The capability ladder also explains the difference between the earliest
strict LLM-only control and the stronger four-arm target-history baseline:

| Ladder step | What changed | Mean Sharpe | Median Sharpe | P10 Sharpe | Median max DD | Median return/DD | Mean candidates |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Original strict LLM-only no skill / no graph | LLM chooses from summary stats only; no empirical candidate grid | `0.2016` | `0.2205` | `-0.3199` | `-0.3184` | `0.4487` | `40.0` |
| Four-arm no skill / no graph target-history baseline | Scores deterministic target-history candidates while keeping skill and graph disabled | `0.7617` | `0.7530` | `0.4686` | `-0.2616` | `5.7652` | `40.0` |
| Graph only | Adds causal graph candidate expansion without Abel Invest workflow instructions | `0.9514` | `0.9374` | `0.6461` | `-0.2527` | `9.5752` | `198.2` |
| Skill only | Adds Abel Invest workflow discipline without causal graph access | `0.8194` | `0.8088` | `0.5126` | `-0.1916` | `5.7444` | `40.0` |
| Skill + graph | Combines Abel Invest workflow with causal graph candidate expansion | `1.0245` | `1.0099` | `0.7089` | `-0.1666` | `8.1007` | `207.0` |

The information-gain story is visible in the factor isolation:

| Capability contrast | What improved | Readout |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full stack vs no skill / no graph | End-to-end strategy quality | `+0.2653` mean Sharpe; `+0.2287` median Sharpe; `710` vs `93` Sharpe wins. |
| Graph effect with skill held fixed | Causal-driver search | `+0.2125` mean Sharpe; `599` vs `3` Sharpe wins with `233` ties; candidate search expands from `40.0` to `207.0` mean candidates. |
| Graph effect without skill | Graph signal value independent of Abel workflow | `+0.1897` mean Sharpe; `724` vs `54` Sharpe wins with `181` ties. |
| Skill effect with graph held fixed | Workflow discipline and risk control | `+0.0690` mean Sharpe; `646` vs `154` drawdown wins. |
| Skill effect without graph | Skill value independent of causal graph | `+0.0590` mean Sharpe; `781` vs `173` drawdown wins. |

Graph access turns target-only search into a graph-neighbor discovery problem:
it adds causal-driver candidates that a plain price-history search cannot see.
The Abel Invest skill turns that larger search space into a repeatable workflow:
workspace readiness, data preparation, scouting, generated strategy engines,
debugging, recorded runs, and audit trails. Together they create a visibly
better risk-adjusted discovery system, not just a bigger brute-force search.
