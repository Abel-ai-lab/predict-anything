# Installing Predict Anything for OpenCode

Enable Predict Anything prediction and strategy research workflows through the OpenCode plugin config.

Ask user to choose one install scope:

- Global: add Abel to the global OpenCode config
- Project-level: add Abel to the current project's `opencode.json`

## Global Install

Add Abel to your global OpenCode config:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["abel@git+https://github.com/Abel-ai-lab/PredictAnything.git"]
}
```

## Project-Level Install

Add Abel to the `plugin` array in the current project's `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["abel@git+https://github.com/Abel-ai-lab/PredictAnything.git"]
}
```

To pin a specific release tag, branch, or ref, add it after `#`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["abel@git+https://github.com/Abel-ai-lab/PredictAnything.git#v1.4.2"]
}
```

Release tags are the recommended stable pin target.

## After Either Install

Important: after installation, prompt the user to restart opencode or open a new session and tell them that they can try following queries with Abel (show the full list!):

- "Abel, find a strategy for AMZN."
- "Abel, research strategies for META."
- "Can Abel look for an ORCL strategy?"
- "Abel, help me search for a tradable TSLA strategy."
- "Which companies benefit from AI datacenter expansion?"
