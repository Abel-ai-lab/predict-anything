# Developer Builds

This page is for maintainers who need to build local Abel Strategy Research Skills artifacts from repository source.

## Build The Abel Strategy Research Skill Collection

Use this when you want to rebuild the public strategy research `skills/` tree from the
maintainer-owned collection source under `maintainers/skills/`.

Public-safe render:

```bash
python3 maintainers/render_collection.py --profile prod --output-dir skills
```

Local SIT-style render:

```bash
python3 maintainers/render_collection.py --include-local --profile sit --output-dir dist/local/skills
```

Expected output:

- public rendered collection: `skills/`
- local rendered collection: `dist/local/skills/`

The shared profile source lives at `maintainers/endpoints.json`. Local private
overrides can live in `maintainers/endpoints.local.json`, or continue to use
the legacy `maintainers/causal-abel/endpoints.local.json` path.

## Build A Local Ask-Skill Version

Use this when you only want a focused `abel-ask` render for smoke probes or
debugging. This wrapper uses the same shared collection profile config.

```bash
python3 maintainers/abel-ask/render_skill.py --profile prod --output-dir skills/abel-ask
python3 maintainers/abel-ask/render_skill.py --include-local --profile sit --output-dir dist/local/abel-ask
```

## Verify The Local Ask-Skill Version

Run the maintainer smoke probe against the local rendered tree:

```bash
python3 maintainers/abel-ask/smoke_cap_probe.py
```

To point at a different skill root:

```bash
python3 maintainers/abel-ask/smoke_cap_probe.py --skill-root skills/abel-ask
```

## Build A ClawHub Release Version

Use this when you want the publishable ClawHub package artifact for OpenClaw.
The artifact is a native OpenClaw plugin with `openclaw.plugin.json` and all
public Abel skill directories listed explicitly in `openclaw.plugin.json`.

```bash
python3 scripts/build_clawhub_release.py
```

Expected output:

- publishable artifact: `dist/clawhub/abel/`

You can also choose a different output root:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_clawhub_release.py --output-root dist/test-clawhub
```

Expected output in that case:

- publishable artifact: `dist/test-clawhub/abel/`

## Dry-Run A ClawHub Publish

Before a real release, verify the publish command and computed version:

```bash
python3 scripts/publish_clawhub_release.py --dry-run
```

Or with a custom build root:

```bash
python3 scripts/publish_clawhub_release.py --output-root dist/test-clawhub --dry-run
```

The dry-run should print a `clawhub package publish ... --dry-run` command for
the built bundle artifact.

## Real ClawHub Publish

When the artifact and version look correct:

```bash
python3 scripts/publish_clawhub_release.py
```

This publishes from built output. Do not commit generated ClawHub artifacts back into the repository.
