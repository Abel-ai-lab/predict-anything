# Methodology

Use this optional reference when the user asks why the workflow is graph-first,
why evidence labels are strict, or why the framework refuses to recommend the
next strategy route.

## Boundary

The product boundary is:

```text
framework = evidence validity and exploration-shape facts
agent = strategy judgment and research insight
```

`abel-edge` owns runtime legality and validation metrics.
`abel-invest` owns branch declarations, evidence labels, frontier
facts, and the exploration path surface.

## Core Principles

**Causal graph first.**
Use Abel-discovered causal structure as the default search prior because it
reduces blind search and is more likely to survive regime change. Correlation
signals can still be useful, but they enter as supplements or controls unless
the branch declares and validates a stronger claim.

CAP graph nodes are model-supported causal priors, not trading instructions.
`discovery-protocol.md` owns CAP role interpretation, frontier expansion, and
mechanism-depth-before-breadth rules. The methodological point is simpler:
graph-first means using the graph to form input and mechanism hypotheses, not to
prescribe a strategy or justify metric-chasing expansion.

**Mechanism seeds; the gauntlet gates; optimization is first-class.**
Graph and mechanism priors seed candidates. That is what keeps the search
space small enough for DSR to survive at scale: the causal prior is a
multiple-testing regularizer on the driver-selection axis (a large
multiplicative factor in K). Optimization toward the objective is then a
first-class path, not a deviation, provided every candidate clears the full
gauntlet (semantic, gate/DSR/triangle, leakage, walk-forward) and
`--selection-trials` accounts the true K. The failure mode to avoid is
selecting on a raw metric OUTSIDE the gauntlet — not optimization itself.

**Evidence entry; mechanism is post-hoc.**
A candidate enters on gauntlet / OOS survival, never on the strength of its
mechanism story. The mechanism narrative is a post-hoc Insight Card written
after a candidate survives — it explains, it does not admit. Graph and
mechanism priors *seed and bound* the search (the causal regularizer); they
do not gate entry — survival does. This supports systematic construction when
the search question requires it, but it does not make complexity self-justifying.
See `references/principles-to-test.md` for non-canonical broader construction
principles.

`--selection-trials` is the honest K-accounting that makes guarded
optimization legitimate, not a marker that search is illegitimate. abel-invest
runs guarded optimization self-contained; it does not hand off to any external
skill.

**Narrative scout is context, not evidence.**
Abel Ask and narrative context can generate mechanism hypotheses, supplement
driver ideas, and graph expansion questions. Treat them as domain-context scout
work: stronger than free association, weaker than CAP graph facts, and never a
substitute for Edge validation. `discovery-protocol.md` owns the scout trigger
and workflow details.

**Evidence labels are not strategy advice.**
Candidate/control/diagnostic/blocker labels say what kind of research evidence a
run produced. They do not choose the next driver, model, threshold, or mechanism.

**Runtime legality is non-negotiable.**
If a strategy reads information it could not have seen at decision time, the
backtest is invalid. The current authoring contract expresses legal reads
through `DecisionContext` and semantic preflight.

**Multi-dimensional validation beats single-metric selection.**
The validation profile can evolve, but the principle is stable: avoid promoting
strategies from one attractive metric when other evidence says the signal is
fragile, concentrated, or illegal.

**Serial compounding beats static grids.**
Each round should update the agent's understanding. Static parameter grids can
hide whether the search is learning or just overfitting a neighborhood.

**The exploration path is agent-readable and evidence-linked.**
`exploration_path.md` preserves the chosen path, why it was chosen, Edge
feedback, and ledger/artifact references between turns. It is the human-facing
research log, while evidence truth remains in the ledger and raw artifacts.

## Current Workflow Consequence

The branch-default path is:

1. resolve workspace and doctor readiness
2. start or resume a graph-first session
3. read ledger, frontier, and exploration path facts
4. use one narrative scout pass when the next decision is ambiguous between
   mechanism-deepening, graph expansion, or stopping
5. deepen the current mechanism when unresolved sign, lag, regime, interaction,
   control, or risk-shaping questions remain
6. expand `graph_frontier.json` only when current evidence leaves a frontier
   question unresolved
7. declare branch hypothesis and selected graph inputs
8. prepare branch inputs
9. write `compute_decisions(self, ctx)`
10. run semantic preflight
11. record evidence
12. inspect ledger/frontier facts
13. keep `exploration_path.md` covered before deep local refinement
