# Scaling Discipline (procedure)

**When**: every abel-invest mandate — always-on temperament. Read at session
start and again before writing any "exhausted / ceiling / no edge" conclusion.

**Why** — canonical in `methodology.md` (data-driven entry) +
`guarded-optimization.md` (the gauntlet gates). Not restated here. One line:
the causal scaling law is REAL but **edge-conditional** — brute-force
data-driven search is king only *through the honest gate* and only *when the
edge exists*; so force the extreme data-driven loop by default and prove
exhaustion by ledger, never by vibe.

Self-contained: abel-invest's own CLI + engine.py + branch flow only. No
abelian / external skill.

## Mandatory data-driven entry — not advice

- The FIRST recorded `candidate` round MUST be a machine feature factory over
  the **multi-hop** causal frontier (parents + blanket + children + 2-hop),
  fed to a **heterogeneous** ensemble (≥2 model families, diversity-gated).
- Hand-designed single-mechanism rounds are DIAGNOSTICS, never the baseline.
  A hand-picked-feature round before a machine-factory round is a violation.
- Denoise is first-class, ranked by evidence: unsupervised (PCA/ICA/AE)
  **>** filter-select **>** supervised (PLS). PLS overfits weak edges.
- This is Pillar-2 of `data-driven-construction.md` made obligatory, not
  optional. Skipping it = skipping the search.

## Honest-K is the scaling law's governor

- `--selection-trials` = THIS round's search width ONLY (model families ×
  HPO trials × denoise variants × feature-sets tried *in this round*). The
  framework accumulates the campaign total itself
  (`build_dsr_trials_context`: `K = Σ prior rounds' current_round_trials +
  this round`). Passing a running/cumulative total DOUBLE-COUNTS prior rounds
  and corrupts DSR — the cardinal K error. Per-round width, never cumulative.
- DSR deflates as the framework-accumulated campaign K grows. Therefore: on a
  real edge the breakthrough lands in **1-2 rounds**; if many rounds are
  needed, the edge is absent and more search is **negative-EV** (K rises
  faster than Sharpe). State this up front. (Caveat: this dynamic is only
  trustworthy with correct per-round K accounting — a cumulative-pass bug
  inflates K and can falsely manufacture the "self-defeat" signal.)
- Strong edge → scaling holds (force the loop hard). Weak/absent edge →
  scaling self-defeats (the gate correctly refuses to manufacture alpha).
  Do not mistake "more compute" for "more alpha".

## Exhaustion is ledger-proven, never asserted

Before writing "exhausted / CLOSED / ceiling / no untested mechanism", the
ledger MUST show, all K-accounted:

1. machine feature factory ✓
2. ≥1 unsupervised denoise ✓
3. heterogeneous diversity-gated ensemble ✓
4. multi-hop frontier (≥3 graph nodes) ✓

Missing any → the verdict is premature; run it first. A green per-candidate
gauntlet does NOT certify search exhaustiveness — it never has.

## Loop inversion

The candidate space is machine-generated (factory × zoo × denoise × frontier);
the agent scopes the mandate, audits the gate verdict, decides pivot/stop.
Agent hand-design is the exception and must carry an explicit journal
justification.

## Anti-patterns

- Hand-picked features as the baseline; machine factory as a "late lever".
- Declaring exhaustion without Pillars 1-4 in the ledger (premature CLOSED is
  the cardinal process violation — the recurring conclude-before-verify).
- Un-K'd HPO / denoise / model-zoo search.
- Treating `data-driven-construction.md` as advice rather than contract.
- Inferring a standard instead of reading it (skill artifacts → read
  `AGENTS.md` + skill-creator + a same-type file FIRST).
- Selecting on a metric outside the gauntlet (see `guarded-optimization.md`).

## Cross-references

- `data-driven-construction.md` — the factory + ensemble this enforces.
- `guarded-optimization.md` — the gauntlet K-accounting this governs.
- `methodology.md` — why graph-first / evidence-boundary.
