  High-capacity audited quant alpha discovery with causal graph priors. Use this
  skill whenever the user wants to find, improve, screen, backtest, or stress a
  trading strategy / alpha / signal, explore whether an asset has tradable
  edge, run graph-enriched feature-factory, model, or ensemble search, or continue/prepare/debug an Abel
  strategy-discovery workspace — even if they don't say "Abel" and even when
  they do not name Sharpe, return, drawdown, or another metric target. Default
  to high-capacity empirical alpha exploration with Sharpe > 2 as the aspirational
  target unless the user gives a different target. Prefer this over ad-hoc
  hand-designed strategy work.

# Abel Invest Alpha Search

Use this skill for:

- alpha search and candidate screening
- continuing an existing Abel strategy discovery workspace
- creating sessions and branches
- preparing, debugging, recording, and reviewing strategy rounds
- interpreting `evidence_ledger.json`, `frontier.md`, `agent_context.md`, and
  `exploration_path.md`

## Activation Checklist

Always start by resolving workspace state before strategy work.

1. Read `references/workspace-bootstrap.md`.
2. Resolve the workspace context:
   - if `alpha.workspace.yaml` is in the current directory, use the current
     directory
   - else if `abel-invest-workspace/alpha.workspace.yaml` exists
     under the current directory, use that child workspace
   - else bootstrap a workspace before deep strategy work
3. Prefer `abel-invest workspace context --path . --json` once a CLI is
   available. If `abel-invest` is not on PATH and an existing workspace has a
   venv, use `<workspace-root>/.venv/bin/abel-invest workspace context --path . --json`
   for this first context check. Use the returned `workspace_root`,
   `research_root`, and `command_prefix` instead of guessing from directory
   names or assuming a global PATH.
4. Baseline-first: before from-scratch search, check whether a validated
   strategy for this target already exists in any baseline / strategy catalog
   the user maintains. If one exists, treat it as a benchmark and launchpad;
   iterate from it when useful rather than wasting rounds rediscovering it.
5. Run `<command_prefix> doctor --path <workspace-root>`.
6. If doctor reports `runtime_stale`, `env_missing`, `edge_missing`, or
   `edge_contract_missing`, run the exact command from `next_step`, then rerun
   doctor. `doctor` diagnoses runtime drift; `env` commands repair it.
7. If doctor reports `auth_missing`, use `abel-auth`, then rerun doctor.
8. Only start or continue session/branch work after doctor is ready, unless the
   user explicitly asks you to inspect or repair setup.

## Reference Routing

- New workspace, workspace reuse, auth, doctor, or setup repair:
  read `references/workspace-bootstrap.md`.
- New session, normal round loop, or resuming a session:
  read `references/experiment-loop.md`.
- Explicit simple/no-leverage validation profile or compatibility work:
  read `references/grandma-mode.md`.
- Live graph discovery, graph frontier expansion, or graph-informed alpha context:
  read `references/discovery-protocol.md`.
- Creating or revising `branch.yaml`, reviewing evidence labels,
  path coverage, input realization, or exploration path use:
  read `references/branch-authoring.md`.
- Writing `engine.py`, handling semantic/runtime failures, or checking
  temporal legality:
  read `references/constraints.md`.
- Explaining why the workflow is data-led, graph-informed, or evidence-boundary oriented:
  optionally read `references/methodology.md`.
- Choosing concrete constructions while writing the engine:
  read `references/proven-patterns.md` (battle-tested patterns). Core path.
- Search-width accounting, selected-candidate reporting, or final-K validation:
  read `references/guarded-optimization.md`. Core path when a submitted
  candidate was selected from probes, sweeps, grids, model comparison, HPO,
  feature screening, node-subset search, or any other empirical search.
- Before writing "exhausted / ceiling / no edge":
  read `references/experiment-loop.md` and check the ledger requirements there.
- Data-driven candidate construction, especially when ordinary alpha search
  risks becoming another simple hand-written rule:
  read `references/data-driven-construction.md`. Core path.

## Operating Rules

Always:

- Work workspace-first. Resolve `workspace_root`, `research_root`, and doctor
  status before session or branch work.
- Reuse the default workspace when it already exists; reuse any resolved
  existing workspace before bootstrapping another one.
- Bootstrap the workspace before deep strategy work when no workspace exists.
- Use Abel Invest commands through the workspace `command_prefix` when
  available, not old aliases.
- On a fresh install where `abel-invest` is not installed, run
  `python3 <abel-invest-skill-root>/scripts/bootstrap_workspace.py --path abel-invest-workspace`.
  Do not import `abel_invest` with the system interpreter for first-run
  bootstrap.
- If a skill update changed the workspace runtime contract, `doctor` reports
  `runtime_stale`. Run the suggested `next_step` command and rerun doctor before
  strategy work. Do not refresh on every entry when doctor is already ready.
- Reuse existing Abel auth first. If live access is missing, use `abel-auth` and
  rerun `doctor`.
- Report to the user with the current workspace/session/branch path, doctor
  status, blockers, what evidence exists, and the next action you will take.
- Treat `agent_context.md` as the compact factual resume surface,
  `exploration_path.md` as the human-facing chosen-path and Edge-feedback log.
- Baseline-first: before from-scratch search, check whether a validated
  strategy for this target already exists in any baseline / strategy catalog the
  user maintains. If one exists, treat it as a benchmark and launchpad; iterate
  from it when useful rather than wasting rounds rediscovering it.

Never:

- Do not create sessions before workspace context resolves.
- Do not use `--root` unless intentionally creating a legacy/offline session;
  then pass `--allow-outside-workspace`.
- Do not treat `branch.yaml` as evidence. It is an audit declaration.
- Do not treat `evidence_ledger.json`, `frontier.md`, or `agent_context.md` as
  generated strategy advice. They are factual surfaces.
- Do not hide parameter, sizing, threshold, filter, model, factor, or node-subset
  search inside one "single" strategy. Name search width honestly.
- Do not treat scratch scripts, local probes, scout results, or narrative
  context as validation evidence.
- Do not edit durable branch code just to scout. Use the session scratch
  workbench or an equivalent disposable surface until the candidate shape is
  ready to promote.
- Do not submit an unscouted whole-frontier or whole-feature basket as formal
  evidence when a narrow scout question could first identify sign, horizon,
  subset, feature-family, model-family, or risk-shape facts.
- Do not report a raw-metric winner as a robust strategy before it clears the
  gauntlet with honest search-width accounting.
- Do not treat `--selection-trials` as a strategy-quality shortcut; it is honest
  DSR/K accounting that makes empirical search reportable.
- Never pass a running/cumulative total to `--selection-trials`; pass this
  round's search width only.
- Do not depend on any external skill for guarded optimization; abel-invest runs
  it self-contained.

Alpha search stance:

- Abel Invest has one default identity: high-capacity audited alpha discovery.
  User constraints such as simple, interpretable, no leverage, only validate
  this idea, or no parameter search narrow the search space for that request;
  they do not switch the product into a different research personality.
- Absence of an explicit metric target is not a request for narrow validation.
  The default objective is to find a strong tradable strategy, with Sharpe > 2
  as the aspirational target unless the user gives another target, while
  controlling drawdown and preserving reportable evidence quality.
- Wide universe. Narrow question. High-capacity promotion. Harsh reporting. Let
  observed results, failure modes, and metric shape choose the next candidate
  family. Mechanism stories are useful after evidence appears; they are not
  admission tickets.
- Default loop: start from target behavior plus live graph-derived inputs,
  feature factories, model families, ensembles, regimes, sizing, filters, and
  subset search; scout one sharp question at a time; then promote the strongest
  discovered candidate shape through prepare/debug/run with honest current-round
  search-width accounting.
- Use `research/<ticker>/<session_id>/scratch/` as the session-local scout
  workbench for empirical probes. Scratch files can be one-off scripts,
  notebooks, query snippets, compact feature screens, model comparisons, or
  notes. If the runtime makes scratch files awkward, an equivalent one-off
  shell heredoc, notebook cell, or query cell is fine. Scratch exists to enable
  high-capacity search without turning raw probes into evidence; only the scout
  summary, promotion rationale, and effective selection width belong in
  `exploration_path.md`, `branch.yaml`, or a recorded run.
- Formal candidates do not have to be simple or hand-written. They can be
  learned models, dense ensembles, feature-factory outputs, graph-node subset
  models, or hybrids. Promote the discovered form faithfully; do not replace an
  ML, feature-factory, ensemble, or hybrid lead with a simple rule proxy just
  because it feels easier to explain. Formal promotion means reproducible,
  temporally legal, selected, and honestly K-accounted; it does not mean low
  capacity.
- Ordinary alpha search has a default posture: high-capacity empirical
  construction over a target + graph-derived universe. The agent should use the
  graph, target behavior, feature construction, model comparison, denoise,
  subset search, regimes, sizing, filters, or ensembles as data calls for them;
  these are degrees of freedom, not a scripted route.
- New sessions use live causal graph discovery when available. Treat the graph
  as the default high-value alpha feature universe beyond target-only history:
  node subsets, lags, signs, transformations, ratios, regimes, model features,
  sizing signals, filters, and ensemble members are all fair game.
- Graph-enriched ideas should appear early and recur throughout ordinary search
  unless a validated baseline already defines the immediate path, user
  constraints explicitly narrow the allowed inputs, or live graph access is
  blocked. Do not turn this into a full-frontier quota or a broad basket ritual.
- Target-only work is useful as a baseline, seed, ablation, or competing
  candidate. It should not become the lazy default when live graph candidates
  are available; use it to measure whether graph-derived information improves
  the objective or robustness.
- A graph-supported branch is not automatically data-driven. Runtime graph reads
  prove input realization; they do not replace feature construction, model
  comparison, subset/lag/sign search, denoise, or ensemble search.
- Hand-written single-mechanism branches are diagnostics, controls, ablations,
  or refinements around empirical construction. They are useful, but they are
  not the product's default search engine when live graph-derived data and
  high-capacity construction are available.
- `--selection-trials N` is mandatory for any search width. `N` is this round's
  width only; the framework accumulates the campaign total from prior PASS/FAIL
  rounds itself. Fold preflight/ERROR-disqualified variants into a later
  per-round count when they would otherwise be skipped. See
  `references/guarded-optimization.md`.
- Graph-derived search should mine the causal node universe empirically. Let
  data select subsets, lags, transformations, models, and graph roles. Graph
  expansion is available when evidence points outside the current view, but it
  is not a coverage ritual.
- Exhaustion is ledger-proven, never asserted. Do not write "exhausted",
  "ceiling", or "no edge" unless the ledger shows, K-accounted: the candidate
  universe searched, materially different search axes, graph-derived and
  target/baseline contrasts where useful, any intentionally tested principle and
  its search impact, and all attempted width including otherwise-skipped
  ERROR/preflight variants. A green per-candidate gauntlet does not certify
  search exhaustiveness.
- CAP graph nodes are model-supported causal priors. Trust that they carry
  target-relevant information, but do not infer disclosed weight, exact lag,
  signed effect, monotone strength, or tradable direction from the role alone.
  Parent and child roles disclose causal-flow orientation; Abel Invest's
  `blanket` role is a Markov-blanket discovery bucket, not a fixed causal-flow
  direction.
- When claiming graph-derived contribution, keep the graph use contract clear:
  selected nodes, construction, intended role, unresolved assumption, and
  falsification scope. This can be lightweight before validation and richer
  after a pass or meaningful near-pass.
- If a branch combines multiple graph nodes as one same-direction, equal-weight,
  or same-lag basket, declare that construction explicitly. A failed basket only
  invalidates that construction unless other evidence supports a broader graph
  conclusion.
- Expand the graph frontier only when it helps the empirical search question.
  Do not expand merely to satisfy graph coverage or make the exploration look
  broader.
- Branch count is not proof of breadth. Graph-node concentration, model/factor
  coverage, strategy-variant coverage, and local refinement are separate facts.
- Abel Ask or narrative context can scout candidate ideas, supplemental drivers,
  or graph expansion questions. It is not validation evidence.
- Use narrative scout context only when it helps generate candidate features,
  graph expansion anchors, or interpretation. It is optional context, not a
  required ritual.
- Every recorded round requires an `exploration_path.md` entry with the chosen
  path, compact reason, Edge feedback, round ledger reference, and any scout
  influence before the next recorded round.
- Input realization is evidence: a graph-supported declaration only becomes
  graph-supported evidence when runtime reads the prepared graph inputs.
  When graph-node reads are inferred from asset reads, preserve that source as a
  fact rather than overstating edge-native field-level proof.
- The framework defines legality, evidence validity, search-width accounting,
  and reportability. The agent owns the alpha search.
- Explicit simple/no-leverage compatibility sessions may use the `grandma_daily`
  profile. Treat that as a user constraint and validation profile, not a second
  Abel Invest research personality.

Visualization and promotion:

- Do not create or refresh an online session view automatically.
- When the strategy context is mature enough for visual review, ask the user
  whether to visualize it.
- If the user agrees or explicitly asks, run
  `<command_prefix> visualize-session --session <session>`
  yourself and share the returned Markdown link.
- Use `visualize-session --without-strategy-artifact` only when the user
  explicitly asks for a session view without strategy artifact upload.
- If visualization reports `needs_agent_refactor`, handle the emitted
  `refactor-request.json` in this same skill loop. For `state_intent_self_check`,
  write `state_intent.json`. For `agent_assisted`, edit only the promoted copy,
  write `refactor-report.json`, and rerun the same command.
- The default Abel router base URL is `https://api.abel.ai/router/`. `abel-auth`
  owns API key setup; do not ask for a router URL unless the user is testing a
  non-default router.

Glossary:

- CAP: Abel causal graph surface used as a prior.
- Edge: Abel runtime that prepares data and validates strategies.
- DSR: deflated Sharpe ratio accounting; `--selection-trials` records effective
  search width and does not replace final validation.
- Ledger: `evidence_ledger.json`, the evidence record.
- Frontier: `frontier.md` / `frontier.json`, factual search coverage.
- PASS/FAIL: Edge validation verdicts, not instructions to stop thinking.
- Scout/probe: temporary exploration used to choose a formal candidate; useful
  for search, not validation evidence.
- Narrative scout: Abel Ask/domain-context pass used for candidate generation,
  not validation.
