This is an Abel Invest alpha-search workspace.

Treat this directory as the canonical workspace for this working area.
Treat this workspace's `.venv` as the canonical runtime for daily alpha search.
From this workspace root, use `./.venv/bin/abel-invest` as the command prefix,
or activate `.venv` first and then use `abel-invest`.
If `alpha.workspace.yaml` already exists here, this directory is already the
workspace root. Do not bootstrap `./abel-invest-workspace` inside it.

The CLI commands below keep alpha search auditable inside this workspace. The
point is not to memorize a checklist. The point is to search hard while keeping
the current state legible from session setup into branch evidence.

## A Usual Path

Run these commands from the workspace root:

```bash
./.venv/bin/abel-invest workspace context --path . --json
./.venv/bin/abel-invest doctor
{default_activate_command()}
./.venv/bin/abel-invest init-session --ticker TSLA --exp-id tsla-v1
./.venv/bin/abel-invest frontier status --session research/tsla/tsla-v1
./.venv/bin/abel-invest init-branch --session research/tsla/tsla-v1 --branch-id <candidate-branch>
```

Read or edit these files before the first recorded round:

- `research/tsla/tsla-v1/branches/<candidate-branch>/branch.yaml`
- `research/tsla/tsla-v1/exploration_path.md`
- `research/tsla/tsla-v1/branches/<chosen-branch>/engine.py`

Then run the branch preflight and recorded round:

```bash
./.venv/bin/abel-invest prepare-branch --branch research/tsla/tsla-v1/branches/<chosen-branch>
./.venv/bin/abel-invest debug-branch --branch research/tsla/tsla-v1/branches/<chosen-branch>
./.venv/bin/abel-invest run-branch --branch research/tsla/tsla-v1/branches/<chosen-branch> -d "candidate search result"
```

After every recorded round, keep `exploration_path.md` covered with ledger ref,
chosen path, compact reason, Edge feedback, and artifact refs before another
recorded round.

Only after asking the user and getting agreement to create a session review
page, run:

```bash
./.venv/bin/abel-invest visualize-session --session research/tsla/tsla-v1
```

Use that path as orientation, not as a rigid script. The important boundary is:
- `doctor` tells you whether the workspace is actually ready
- `workspace context --json` tells you the owning workspace and `research_root`
- `branch.yaml` makes the branch inputs explicit
- `prepare-branch` resolves inputs before you treat any round as evidence
- the starter `engine.py` is only there to verify branch wiring before a branch-specific candidate exists
- new sessions default to data-led alpha search with graph-enriched context:
  use `graph_frontier.json` as the high-value expanded feature universe for
  feature factories, model/denoise lanes, node-subset search, lag/sign search,
  regimes, filters, sizing, and ensembles; do not reduce graph use to a
  full-frontier quota or a few hand-written node rules
- target-only candidates are baselines, seeds, ablations, and competitors for
  measuring graph-derived marginal contribution, not the default main lane when
  graph-derived data is live and unsearched
- every recorded round requires an `exploration_path.md` entry with ledger ref,
  chosen path, compact reason, Edge feedback, and artifact refs before the next
  recorded round
- every next Edge run should be chosen after reading `exploration_path.md` and
  the latest Edge result; `run-branch` appends a concise entry there

## Re-entry

- if `alpha.workspace.yaml` exists in the current directory, continue here and do not create `./abel-invest-workspace`
- if you open this workspace root again later, continue here
- if you open the parent launch directory later, reuse its child `abel-invest-workspace` before creating another one
- do not create a second workspace in the same area unless you want one intentionally
- create new sessions only after workspace context resolves; use `--root` only
  for intentional outside-workspace legacy/offline sessions and pass
  `--allow-outside-workspace`

## What This Workspace Makes Explicit

- session owns `graph_frontier.json` and `readiness.json`
- session owns `evidence_ledger.json`, `frontier.md`, `agent_context.md`,
  and `exploration_path.md` after rendering
- branch owns `branch.yaml`
- edge owns the market-data cache
- `prepare-branch` should run before a recorded round
- `frontier.md` reports input realization: declared graph-supported inputs only
  count as realized when the engine reads prepared graph inputs
- `visualize-session` is the default composite entrypoint for session
  visualization: it creates an online session view and, when a hostable
  validation strategy is available, includes selected strategy artifact
  upload/promotion through the strategy-artifact capability. Direct artifact
  export/promotion remain independent commands. If a selected strategy emits a
  hosted-paper contract request, continue that loop; if it
  cannot complete, report the session as `action_required`
- session `backtest_start` is a default target; branch `requested_start` can override it explicitly
- the generated `engine.py` is a starter wiring scaffold for the first end-to-end run, not a finished strategy

## Workspace Boundary

- This workspace is for alpha-managed strategy search.
- Keep sessions and branches under `research/`.
- Do not run `abel-edge init` inside this workspace.
- If you need a standalone Abel-edge project, create it in a separate directory outside this workspace.

If the workspace runtime is missing or you want to replace it, run the env
repair command from `doctor`'s `next_step`.
If `doctor` reports `runtime_stale`, run the command from `next_step`, then
rerun `doctor`.
If your environment cannot create a new venv, point alpha at an existing
interpreter by adding `--runtime-python /path/to/python` to that env repair
command.

## Readiness Gate

Run `./.venv/bin/abel-invest workspace context --path . --json` and `./.venv/bin/abel-invest doctor`
before opening a session.

- `ready`: you can start alpha search
- `ready` means continue with `init-session -> init narrow scout/candidate branch -> prepare-branch -> first-look data scout before any broad run`
- `auth_missing`: no reusable auth was found; use `abel-auth`, then rerun `doctor`
- `runtime_stale`, `env_missing`, `edge_missing`, or `edge_contract_missing`:
  run the exact env repair command from `next_step`, then rerun `doctor`

# AGENTS.md — Abel Invest Alpha Search Workspace

Use this workspace as the default place to continue alpha search for this working
area. The CLI commands below are tools for operating inside this workspace, but
the goal is to keep the current branch state understandable rather than to
follow a rigid script.
From this workspace root, use `./.venv/bin/abel-invest` as the command prefix,
or activate `.venv` first and then use `abel-invest`.

## I want to...

### Check whether this directory is a valid workspace
```bash
./.venv/bin/abel-invest workspace context --path . --json
./.venv/bin/abel-invest workspace status
./.venv/bin/abel-invest doctor
```

If `alpha.workspace.yaml` is already present in this directory, this directory
is the workspace root. Do not create `./abel-invest-workspace` inside it.

### Start a new exploration session
Run these commands from the workspace root:

```bash
./.venv/bin/abel-invest workspace context --path . --json
./.venv/bin/abel-invest doctor
./.venv/bin/abel-invest init-session --ticker TSLA --exp-id tsla-v1
./.venv/bin/abel-invest frontier status --session research/tsla/tsla-v1
./.venv/bin/abel-invest init-branch --session research/tsla/tsla-v1 --branch-id <candidate-branch>
```

Read or edit these files before branch execution:

- `research/tsla/tsla-v1/branches/<candidate-branch>/branch.yaml`
- `research/tsla/tsla-v1/exploration_path.md`
- `research/tsla/tsla-v1/branches/<chosen-branch>/engine.py`

Then run:

```bash
./.venv/bin/abel-invest prepare-branch --branch research/tsla/tsla-v1/branches/<chosen-branch>
./.venv/bin/abel-invest debug-branch --branch research/tsla/tsla-v1/branches/<chosen-branch>
./.venv/bin/abel-invest run-branch --branch research/tsla/tsla-v1/branches/<chosen-branch> -d "candidate search result"
```

Keep `exploration_path.md` covered before another recorded round. Ask the user
before creating an online session view. If the user agrees:

```bash
./.venv/bin/abel-invest visualize-session --session research/tsla/tsla-v1
```

Run `doctor` before `init-session`. If it reports `auth_missing`, use
`abel-auth`, then rerun `doctor`.
If it reports `runtime_stale`, `env_missing`, `edge_missing`, or
`edge_contract_missing`, run the exact env repair command from
`next_step`, then rerun `doctor`. Do not refresh the runtime when `doctor` is
already ready.
Run `workspace context --path . --json` before creating a session so the
session lands under this workspace's `research/` directory. Do not pass
`--root` unless intentionally creating a legacy/offline session outside the
workspace, and then pass `--allow-outside-workspace`.
Treat `branch.yaml` as the place where target, start, selected inputs, objective,
search width, and validation scope become explicit enough to audit. Treat
`prepare-branch` as the moment that makes those inputs real. Treat the generated
`engine.py` as a starter path check; once the branch path is proven, encode the
candidate logic there. Treat session readiness as advisory context; the branch's explicit
`requested_start` is the runtime start when it is set. Treat this workspace
`.venv` as the canonical runtime for daily work. Treat branch count as a
file-organization fact, not as proof of search breadth. Use `exploration_path.md`
as the single human-facing exploration log: record each chosen path, compact
reason, Edge feedback, and ledger ref. Read `exploration_path.md` and the latest
Edge result before choosing the next Edge run; after Edge feedback, keep the
path updated. Check path coverage before starting another round. Check input
realization before claiming graph-derived contribution. Do not create the online
session view automatically; when the exploration is mature enough for review,
ask the user whether to create a session review page. If the user agrees or
explicitly asks to publish the session review page, run
`visualize-session --session <session>` before inspecting Abel Invest
implementation internals. It builds the view from the session folder and, when
available, includes selected strategy artifact upload/promotion. If the user
asks only for a local strategy artifact export or a promotion validation probe,
use `export-strategy-artifact --session <session>`. If the user explicitly
names a branch or round, use `promote-strategy --branch <branch> --round
<round>`.
Do not manually walk `results.tsv` or branch folders to choose the best
session strategy; session-level commands let the CLI select it. If the command
emits a hosted paper `paper-contract-request.json`,
read the request first and use its `reportTemplate`; when `contractGuide` is
needed, open its `referencePath` from the active Abel Invest skill, not from the
workspace or CLI package path.
Edit only when `sourceEditPolicy` says a source edit is required or genuinely
allowed, and declare the paper history boundary in `paper-contract-report.json`.
Rerun the same command afterward. If another request appears, inspect
`validation.lastGateFailure`, `validation.attemptPolicy`, and
`requirements.fallback`, then continue until promotion succeeds, fallback is
eligible and succeeds or fails a gate, or a hard blocker remains. Promotion
converts the selected research strategy into a clean hosted daily live-paper
artifact; do not add one-off schedules or cached tail decisions merely to pass
the gate. Do not start a separate agent process. Leave contract-blocked sessions
as `action_required` unless the user explicitly asks to skip strategy artifacts.
This workspace is for alpha-managed strategy search, so do not create a
standalone `abel-edge init` project inside it. Put standalone edge work in a
separate directory.

### Report to the user
- resolved workspace root and doctor status
- current session and branch path
- live/auth blockers and the exact next command only when you are going to run it
- evidence status honestly: branch declarations are not evidence until prepared and run
- after a recorded round, say that `exploration_path.md` must be updated before another recorded round

### Run one recorded round
```bash
./.venv/bin/abel-invest debug-branch --branch research/tsla/tsla-v1/branches/<chosen-branch>
./.venv/bin/abel-invest run-branch --branch research/tsla/tsla-v1/branches/<chosen-branch> -d "candidate search result"
./.venv/bin/abel-invest promote-strategy --branch research/tsla/tsla-v1/branches/<chosen-branch> --round <round-id>
```

### Understand the workspace layout
- `alpha.workspace.yaml` is the source of truth for workspace defaults
- `research/` stores sessions, branches, and evaluation outputs
- `docs/` stores plans, summaries, and iteration records
- `cache/market_data/` is the edge-owned shared cache root

### Re-enter this workspace later
- if `alpha.workspace.yaml` is in the current directory, continue here directly and do not bootstrap a child workspace
- if you are already in this workspace root, continue here directly
- if you are in the parent launch directory, reuse its `abel-invest-workspace` child before creating another one
- run `./.venv/bin/abel-invest workspace context --path . --json` before creating a session
