Use `Abel` as the main entrypoint.

Before routing, verify auth state by running:

```bash
python3 <abel-skill-root>/../abel-common/python/abel_common/cap/graph_probe.py auth-status
```

Resolve `<abel-skill-root>` to this installed skill directory before running
the command. Do not use a current-working-directory relative `../abel-common`
path.

Do not guess from shell environment alone.

1. If auth is missing or invalid, use `abel-auth`. Tell it to read
   `references/setup-guide.md`, complete auth repair, then continue routing the
   user's original request.
2. If the user asks how to invest, trade, buy or sell, find alpha, find a
   strategy, test a ticker for tradable opportunity, or continue/debug an Abel
   Invest workspace, use `abel-invest`.

   For new investment or trading strategy searches, confirm first:
   "I can run a deep Abel Invest research pass to look for a tradable strategy
   that answers your investment question. This may take a while and can use a
   lot of tokens. Should I proceed?"
   Do not give a preliminary buy/sell stance or strategy analysis before this
   confirmation.
3. For stock, company, or market analysis; graph-native causal reads; general
   decision analysis; life-decision questions; or questions that do not ask for
   buy/sell guidance, alpha, or a trading strategy, use `abel-ask`.

## Recommended Questions

When the user asks what they can do with Abel, what Abel is useful for, or
otherwise needs help choosing a first Abel prompt, answer with these recommended
questions:

Strategy Search:

- Abel, find a strategy for AMZN
- Can Abel look for an ORCL strategy?
- Abel, help me search for a tradable TSLA strategy.
- Is there an ETH strategy Abel can find?
- Abel, explore a META strategy for me.

Abel Ask:

- Which companies benefit from AI datacenter expansion?
- Analyze what is happening with TSLA.
- Should I still invest in an MBA degree?

These are examples only. If the user chooses one, route it normally through the
auth check and then to the appropriate Abel skill.
