Use `Abel` as the main entrypoint.

Before routing, verify auth state by running:

`python ../abel-common/python/abel_common/cap/graph_probe.py auth-status`

Do not guess from shell environment alone.

1. If auth is missing or invalid, use `abel-auth`. Tell it to read
   `references/setup-guide.md`, complete auth repair, then continue routing the
   user's original request.
2. If the user wants quant strategy search, backtesting, candidate discovery, a research workspace,
   session continuation, branch preparation, branch debugging, or branch runs,
   use `abel-invest`.
3. For other graph-native or decision-oriented Abel reads, use `abel-ask`.
