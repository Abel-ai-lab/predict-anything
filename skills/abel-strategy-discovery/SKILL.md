  Use when the user wants Abel strategy discovery, candidate screening, or
  workspace-first research.
---

Use this skill for:

- strategy discovery
- candidate screening
- continuing an existing Abel strategy workspace
- preparing or debugging a research branch

Operating rules:

1. Treat this as a workspace-first flow, not a one-shot answer flow.
2. Reuse the default workspace when it already exists.
3. Bootstrap the workspace before deep strategy work when it does not exist yet.
4. Treat runtime preparation and branch-loop handoff as part of this skill's ownership.
5. Reuse existing Abel auth first. If live access is still missing, use `abel-auth`.
6. Treat `branch.yaml` as a research declaration, not evidence truth.
7. Treat `evidence_ledger.json` and `frontier.md` as factual evidence surfaces,
   not generated strategy advice.
8. Treat `agent_context.md` and `agent_memory.jsonl` as agent-owned resume
   state; do not expect the system to generate next strategy directions.
9. New sessions are graph-first: use live causal graph discovery as the opening
   search prior, then explore strategy variants, then tune parameters.
10. Make at least two agent-chosen hypothesis families explicit before deep
    local refinement, or record an agent-authored single-branch rationale.
11. Do not call parameter, sizing, threshold, filter, or window tweaks broad
    exploration. Use changed-dimension and continuation-rationale fields to keep
    local refinement accountable.
12. When evidence accumulates, write agent-owned memory with ledger or frontier
    references before continuing deep refinement.

Read `references/workspace-bootstrap.md` before bootstrapping a new workspace.
Read `references/branch-authoring.md` before creating or revising a branch.
Read the copied workflow references only when the current step needs them.
