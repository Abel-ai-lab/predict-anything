Use this skill when Abel auth is missing, expired, or needs to be initialized.

1. Check whether usable Abel auth already exists by running:

   `python3 ../abel-common/python/abel_common/cap/graph_probe.py auth-status`

2. Reuse existing auth if present.
3. If auth is missing or invalid, read `references/setup-guide.md` and start the OAuth handoff from there.
4. Persist the resulting key to `skills/abel-auth/.env.skill` for this installed collection.
5. Report whether Abel is ready for live use.
